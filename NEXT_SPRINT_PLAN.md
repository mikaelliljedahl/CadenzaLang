# Cadenza Next Sprint Plan - Phase 5: Self-Hosting Migration & Frontend

## Sprint Goal
**Migrate Cadenza tooling from C# to Cadenza itself (.cdz files) and implement frontend code generation, creating a fully self-hosted ecosystem.**

## Background
With direct compilation successfully implemented in Phase 4, Cadenza now has the foundation to become truly self-hosted. The repository contains C# implementations of analysis tools, LSP server, and package management that were never completed or tested. Meanwhile, `src/Cadenza.Tools/` contains .cdz implementations that demonstrate the self-hosting pattern but have never been tested.

## Key Opportunity
The architecture supports self-hosting through the runtime bridge pattern:
- **Existing .cdz Tools**: 3 tools already written in Cadenza with proper effects/Result types
- **Runtime Bridge**: `Cadenza.Runtime.*` calls enable system operations from .cdz code
- **Direct Compilation**: New `--compile` flag can generate executables from .cdz tools
- **Proven Patterns**: Spec blocks, effects system, and modular design already established

## üéØ NEXT SPRINT PLAN - PHASE 5: SELF-HOSTING MIGRATION & FRONTEND

### Sprint Overview
Transform Cadenza from a language with C# tooling to a fully self-hosted ecosystem where Cadenza tools are written in Cadenza itself, plus add frontend code generation capabilities.

### üö® Critical Discovery
**The existing .cdz tools have never been tested!**
- `src/Cadenza.Tools/linter.cdz` (298 lines) - Static analysis tool
- `src/Cadenza.Tools/dev-server.cdz` (66 lines) - Hot reload development server  
- `src/Cadenza.Tools/simple-dev-server.cdz` (165 lines) - HTTP server with file watching
- **No compiled outputs found** - these tools are completely untested

### Phase 5A: Foundation & Testing (Week 1)
**PRIORITY: CRITICAL** - Test existing .cdz tools before building on them

#### Task 1: Test & Validate Existing .cdz Tools
**Goal**: Verify existing .cdz tools compile and run correctly

**Current State**: ‚ùå UNTESTED
- 3 .cdz tools written but never compiled
- Runtime bridge calls may be unimplemented
- No evidence of functionality verification

**Tasks**:
1. **Compile existing .cdz tools**:
   ```bash
   cadenzac-core --compile src/Cadenza.Tools/linter.cdz -o bin/linter.exe
   cadenzac-core --compile src/Cadenza.Tools/dev-server.cdz -o bin/dev-server.exe
   cadenzac-core --compile src/Cadenza.Tools/simple-dev-server.cdz -o bin/simple-dev-server.exe
   ```

2. **Test functionality**:
   - Run linter on Cadenza codebase to validate static analysis
   - Start dev-server and test hot reload capabilities
   - Verify HTTP server serves content and handles requests
   - Fix any compilation errors or runtime issues

3. **Document runtime dependencies**:
   - Identify which `Cadenza.Runtime.*` calls need implementation
   - Create missing runtime bridge components
   - Ensure proper error handling and logging

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All 3 .cdz tools compile successfully to executables
- Linter produces meaningful analysis output on Cadenza codebase
- Dev server starts and serves HTTP content
- File watching triggers recompilation events
- Runtime bridge calls function correctly

### Phase 5B: Parallel Development Tracks (Week 2-6)

#### Track 1: Frontend Implementation (Subagent) üé®
**Goal**: Implement JavaScript/React code generation for UI components

**Current State**: ‚ùå MISSING
- UI syntax exists in examples but no code generation
- `examples/simple_ui_test.cdz` and `examples/advanced_ui_test.cdz` are syntactically complete
- No JavaScript/React output capability

**Subagent Tasks**:
1. **Analyze existing UI syntax**:
   - Study component declarations with state, events, effects
   - Understand render blocks and JSX-like syntax
   - Map Cadenza UI patterns to React patterns

2. **Create React generator**:
   - `src/Cadenza.Tools/frontend/react-generator.cdz`
   - Component state ‚Üí React hooks (useState, useEffect)
   - Event handlers ‚Üí React event handlers
   - Render blocks ‚Üí JSX syntax
   - Effects ‚Üí appropriate React patterns

3. **Extend DirectCompiler** with `--target react` option:
   - Add JavaScript/React target to DirectCompiler
   - Generate TypeScript definitions
   - Bundle optimization for frontend deployment

4. **Test with examples**:
   ```bash
   cadenzac-core --target react examples/simple_ui_test.cdz -o output/SimpleUI.jsx
   cadenzac-core --target react examples/advanced_ui_test.cdz -o output/Dashboard.tsx
   ```

- Language server protocol implementation needed

**Tasks**:
1. **Create LSP foundation**:
   - `lsp/language-server.cdz` (replace CadenzaLanguageServer.cs)

- Go-to-definition navigation works correctly

#### Track 4: Package Management Migration (Main) üì¶
**Goal**: Replace `src/Cadenza.Package/` C# files with .cdz equivalents

**Current State**: ‚ùå INCOMPLETE C# FILES
- 6 .cs files with package logic but no .csproj
- No evidence of testing or registry integration
- Package management commands needed

**Tasks**:

   - Verify version constraint resolution
   - Test security scanning functionality

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Package commands integrate with main CLI
- Dependency resolution handles complex scenarios
- Security scanning detects vulnerabilities
- Registry integration works with NuGet and Cadenza packages
- cadenzac.json configuration is properly managed

### Phase 5C: Repository Cleanup (Week 7)
**Goal**: Remove C# tooling, consolidate structure

#### Tasks:
1. **Remove empty C# folders**:
   - Delete `src/Cadenza.Analysis/` (8 untested .cs files)
   - Delete `src/Cadenza.LSP/` (6 untested .cs files)
   - Delete `src/Cadenza.Package/` (6 untested .cs files)

2. **Migrate C# implementations to .cdz**:
   - **BlazorGenerator.cs ‚Üí blazor-generator.cdz** (currently in C# for quick implementation)
   - **DirectCompiler extensions ‚Üí .cdz tools**
   - **Any remaining C# tooling code**

2. **Reorganize .cdz tools**:
   - Consolidate all tools in `src/Cadenza.Tools/`
   - Create logical subfolders: `analysis/`, `lsp/`, `package/`, `frontend/`
   - Maintain consistent naming and structure

3. **Update build system**:
   - Compile .cdz tools as part of main build
   - Generate tool executables in bin/ directory
   - Update CI/CD to test .cdz tools

4. **Integration testing**:
   - Test complete toolchain together
   - Verify all tools work with each other
   - Performance testing of .cdz tools vs C# equivalents

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Repository structure is clean and logical
- All .cdz tools compile and run correctly
- Build system generates all necessary executables
- Integration tests pass for complete toolchain
- Performance is acceptable for real usage

### Technical Architecture

#### Runtime Bridge Pattern
All .cdz tools use the established runtime bridge pattern:
```cadenza
// File operations
Cadenza.Runtime.FileSystemRuntime.ReadFile(path)
Cadenza.Runtime.FileSystemRuntime.WriteFile(path, content)

// Process execution
Cadenza.Runtime.ProcessRuntime.ExecuteCommand(cmd, args)

// Network operations
Cadenza.Runtime.HttpServerRuntime.CreateServer(port)
Cadenza.Runtime.WebSocketRuntime.BroadcastMessage(msg)

// Logging
Cadenza.Runtime.LoggingRuntime.LogInfo(message)
Cadenza.Runtime.LoggingRuntime.LogError(error)
```

#### Architecture Consistency
- **Spec blocks**: Document intent, rules, postconditions
- **Effects system**: Explicit `uses [FileSystem, Network, Logging]`
- **Result types**: Comprehensive `Result<T, E>` error handling
- **Modular design**: One responsibility per .cdz file

### Success Metrics

#### Sprint Success Criteria
- [ ] All existing .cdz tools compile and run correctly
- [ ] Frontend code generation produces working React components
- [ ] Analysis tools provide comprehensive Cadenza analysis
- [ ] LSP server works with VS Code/JetBrains IDEs

### Strategic Impact

This sprint transforms Cadenza into a fully self-hosted ecosystem:
- **Proof of Concept**: Demonstrates Cadenza's capabilities for complex tools
- **Developer Experience**: Complete toolchain in single language
- **Frontend Support**: Expands Cadenza into UI development
- **Community Building**: Easier contribution and extension
- **Future Foundation**: Basis for compiler self-hosting

The self-hosting migration proves Cadenza's maturity while the frontend implementation expands its reach into full-stack development scenarios.
